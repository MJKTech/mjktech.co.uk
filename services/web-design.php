					<p>We make a point of having detailed discussions with our clients about their goals and do competitor research to find out what is working for your niche and what isn't.<br/> 
					Then we can iteratively employ techniques like wireframing and prototyping to produce the right UX solution.</p> 
					<p>During any project the primary objective is to realise your vision, but also to captivate your target audience with an innovative user experience.</p>
